          Marrie Curie was a Polish physicist and chemist, born in 1867, who
          lived and worked in France. She and her husband Pierre Curie
          discovered and defined radioactivity along with the radioactive atoms
          Polonium and Radium. Marie Curie received a nobel price 1903 in
          Physics and 1911 in Chemestry. She was the first women to ever receive
          this presticous price and is yet the only women ever to receive 2
          nobel prices. She died in 1934. It is believed her death was due to
          long-term exposure to radiation.
