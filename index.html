          Marie Curie (born 1867) was a Polish physicist and chemist who lived
          and worked in France. She and her husband - Pierre Curie - discovered
          and defined radioactivity and discovered the radioactive atoms
          Polonium and Radium. <br />Marie Curie received two Nobel Prizes. 1903
          in Physics and 1911 in Chemistry. She was the first women to ever
          receive this prestigious price and is yet the only women ever to
          receive 2 Nobel Prizes.<br />
          She died in 1934. It is believed her death was due to long-term
          exposure to radiation.
